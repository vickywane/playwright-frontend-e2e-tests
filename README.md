# Rick 'n' Morty Playwright Component Tests 

This monorepo project contains React, Vue and Svelte applications that display data fetched from the [Rick 'n' Morty REST API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#introduction). 

The component tests for the SearchField, Paginator and Character components across the three applications are contained in the `playwright-ct` branch and are tested using the component test feature from Playwright. 


## Usage

Use the following steps to clone and run the application; 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vickywane/playwright-frontend-e2e-tests.git   
```

```bash
cd playwright-frontend-e2e-tests.git   
```

```bash
git checkout playwright-ct
```

```bash
yarn install 
```
